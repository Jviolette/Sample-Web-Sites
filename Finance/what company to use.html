                        <p>If you don't have a company that offers an investment account, then you will need to set up an account on your own.  I recommend using either Vanguard, Charles Swap or Fidelity.  Simply go to their website and set up an account.  At this point, don't put any money in or choose what funds to buy, just set up the account.</p>
