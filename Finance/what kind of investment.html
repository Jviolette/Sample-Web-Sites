                <h1>What kind of investment.</h1>
                <p>You will now decide what kind of investment (vihical) to use.</p>
                <p>There are two types of investment accounts.  Retirement accounts and Taxable accounts.

                    Retirement accounts have four sub-categories. Two are for work accounts and two for non-work accounts.  
                    
                    Retirement accounts are a lot better for lowering the taxes you have to pay but you have to be 60 years old before you can take the money out.  
                    
                    I recommend that you use a retirement account.

                    <p>You pay the taxes on the income that you put into this account.  You also pay tax on all of the investment gains that you make. Even thougt you dont have to wait to take the money out until you are 60 years old, You will be much better of investing in a retirment account.</p>
